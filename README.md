# short-time-forecast
provide a set of forecasting methodology when the historical data is scarce

## ForecastMethods Class

The `ForecastMethods` class offers a unified interface for applying various time series forecasting techniques, especially suited for scenarios with limited historical data. It supports naive forecasting, statistical and econometric models, as well as grey and fuzzy time series models, enabling robust short-term forecasting.

### Simple Usage

See [`main.py`](main.py) for example usage demonstrating how to apply different forecasting methods to your dataset.

## Possible Roadmap and Future Efforts

1. Expand to more comprehensive methods, such as deep learning-based forecasting.
2. Integrate automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
3. Enhance visualization and interpretability of forecast results.
4. Improve scalability for large datasets and real-time forecasting.
5. Provide benchmarking tools for method comparison.
